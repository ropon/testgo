# Configuration

[Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager) is configured via
command-line flags and a configuration file.
While the command-line flags configure immutable system parameters, the
configuration file defines inhibition rules, notification routing and
notification receivers.

The [visual editor](https://www.prometheus.io/webtools/alerting/routing-tree-editor)
can assist in building routing trees.

To view all available command-line flags, run `alertmanager -h`.

Alertmanager can reload its configuration at runtime. If the new configuration
is not well-formed, the changes will not be applied and an error is logged.
A configuration reload is triggered by sending a `SIGHUP` to the process or
sending an HTTP POST request to the `/-/reload` endpoint.

## Configuration file introduction

To specify which configuration file to load, use the `--config.file` flag.

```bash
./alertmanager --config.file=alertmanager.yml
```

The file is written in the [YAML format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML),
defined by the scheme described below.
Brackets indicate that a parameter is optional. For non-list parameters the
value is set to the specified default.

Generic placeholders are defined as follows:

* `<duration>`: a duration matching the regular expression `((([0-9]+)y)?(([0-9]+)w)?(([0-9]+)d)?(([0-9]+)h)?(([0-9]+)m)?(([0-9]+)s)?(([0-9]+)ms)?|0)`, e.g. `1d`, `1h30m`, `5m`, `10s`
* `<labelname>`: a string matching the regular expression `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`
* `<labelvalue>`: a string of unicode characters
* `<filepath>`: a valid path in the current working directory
* `<boolean>`: a boolean that can take the values `true` or `false`
* `<string>`: a regular string
* `<secret>`: a regular string that is a secret, such as a password
* `<tmpl_string>`: a string which is template-expanded before usage
* `<tmpl_secret>`: a string which is template-expanded before usage that is a secret
* `<int>`: an integer value
* `<regex>`: any valid [RE2 regular expression](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) (The regex is anchored on both ends. To un-anchor the regex, use `.*<regex>.*`.)

The other placeholders are specified separately.

A provided [valid example file](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/blob/main/doc/examples/simple.yml)
shows usage in context.

## File layout and global settings

The global configuration specifies parameters that are valid in all other
configuration contexts. They also serve as defaults for other configuration
sections. The other top-level sections are documented below on this page.

```yaml
global:
  # The default SMTP From header field.
  [ smtp_from: <tmpl_string> ]
  # The default SMTP smarthost used for sending emails, including port number.
  # Port number usually is 25, or 587 for SMTP over TLS (sometimes referred to as STARTTLS).
  # Example: smtp.example.org:587
  [ smtp_smarthost: <string> ]
  # The default hostname to identify to the SMTP server.
  [ smtp_hello: <string> | default = "localhost" ]
  # SMTP Auth using CRAM-MD5, LOGIN and PLAIN. If empty, Alertmanager doesn't authenticate to the SMTP server.
  [ smtp_auth_username: <string> ]
  # SMTP Auth using LOGIN and PLAIN.

  [ smtp_require_tls: <bool> | default = true ]

  # The API URL to use for Slack notifications.
  [ slack_api_url: <secret> ]
  [ slack_api_url_file: <filepath> ]
  [ victorops_api_key: <secret> ]

  [ webex_api_url: <string> | default = "https://webexapis.com/v1/messages" ]
  # The default HTTP client configuration
  [ http_config: <http_config> ]

  # ResolveTimeout is the default value used by alertmanager if the alert does
  # not include EndsAt, after this time passes it can declare the alert as resolved if it has not been updated.
  # This has no impact on alerts from Prometheus, as they always include EndsAt.
  [ resolve_timeout: <duration> | default = 5m ]

# Files from which custom notification template definitions are read.
# The last component may use a wildcard matcher, e.g. 'templates/*.tmpl'.
templates:
  [ - <filepath> ... ]

# The root node of the routing tree.
route: <route>

# A list of notification receivers.
receivers:
  - <receiver> ...

# A list of inhibition rules.
inhibit_rules:
  [ - <inhibit_rule> ... ]

# DEPRECATED: use time_intervals below.
# A list of mute time intervals for muting routes.
mute_time_intervals:
  [ - <mute_time_interval> ... ]

# A list of time intervals for muting/activating routes.
time_intervals:
  [ - <time_interval> ... ]
```

## Route-related settings

Routing-related settings allow configuring how alerts are routed, aggregated, throttled, and muted based on time.

### `<route>`

A route block defines a node in a routing tree and its children. Its optional
configuration parameters are inherited from its parent node if not set.

Every alert enters the routing tree at the configured top-level route, which
must match all alerts (i.e. not have any configured matchers).
It then traverses the child nodes. If `continue` is set to false, it stops
after the first matching child. If `continue` is true on a matching node, the
alert will continue matching against subsequent siblings.
If an alert does not match any children of a node (no matching child nodes, or
none exist), the alert is handled based on the configuration parameters of the
current node.

```yaml
[ receiver: <string> ]
# The labels by which incoming alerts are grouped together. For example,
# multiple alerts coming in for cluster=A and alertname=LatencyHigh would
# be batched into a single group.
#
# To aggregate by all possible labels use the special value '...' as the sole label name, for example:
# group_by: ['...']
# This effectively disables aggregation entirely, passing through all
# alerts as-is. This is unlikely to be what you want, unless you have
# a very low alert volume or your upstream notification system performs
# its own grouping.
[ group_by: '[' <labelname>, ... ']' ]

# Whether an alert should continue matching subsequent sibling nodes.
[ continue: <boolean> | default = false ]

# DEPRECATED: Use matchers below.
# A set of equality matchers an alert has to fulfill to match the node.
match:
  [ <labelname>: <labelvalue>, ... ]

# DEPRECATED: Use matchers below.
# A set of regex-matchers an alert has to fulfill to match the node.
match_re:
  [ <labelname>: <regex>, ... ]

# A list of matchers that an alert has to fulfill to match the node.
matchers:
  [ - <matcher> ... ]

# How long to initially wait to send a notification for a group
# of alerts. Allows to wait for an inhibiting alert to arrive or collect
# more initial alerts for the same group. (Usually ~0s to few minutes.)
# If omitted, child routes inherit the group_wait of the parent route.
[ group_wait: <duration> | default = 30s ]

# How long to wait before sending a notification about new alerts that
# are added to a group of alerts for which an initial notification has
# already been sent. (Usually ~5m or more.) If omitted, child routes
# inherit the group_interval of the parent route.
[ group_interval: <duration> | default = 5m ]

# How long to wait before sending a notification again if it has already
# been sent successfully for an alert. (Usually ~3h or more). If omitted,
# child routes inherit the repeat_interval of the parent route.
# Note that this parameter is implicitly bound by Alertmanager's
# `--data.retention` configuration flag. Notifications will be resent after either
# repeat_interval or the data retention period have passed, whichever
# occurs first. `repeat_interval` should be a multiple of `group_interval`.
[ repeat_interval: <duration> | default = 4h ]

# Times when the route should be muted. These must match the name of a
# mute time interval defined in the mute_time_intervals section.
# Additionally, the root node cannot have any mute times.
# When a route is muted it will not send any notifications, but
# otherwise acts normally (including ending the route-matching process
# if the `continue` option is not set.)
mute_time_intervals:
  [ - <string> ...]

# Times when the route should be active. These must match the name of a
# time interval defined in the time_intervals section. An empty value
# means that the route is always active.
# Additionally, the root node cannot have any active times.
# The route will send notifications only when active, but otherwise
# acts normally (including ending the route-matching process
# if the `continue` option is not set).
active_time_intervals:
  [ - <string> ...]

# Zero or more child routes.
routes:
  [ - <route> ... ]
```

#### Example

```yaml
# The root route with all parameters, which are inherited by the child
# routes if they are not overwritten.
route:
  receiver: 'default-receiver'
  group_wait: 30s
  group_interval: 5m
  repeat_interval: 4h
  group_by: [cluster, alertname]
  # All alerts that do not match the following child routes
  # will remain at the root node and be dispatched to 'default-receiver'.
  routes:
  # All alerts with service=mysql or service=cassandra
  # are dispatched to the database pager.
  - receiver: 'database-pager'
    group_wait: 10s
    matchers:
    - service=~"mysql|cassandra"
  # All alerts with the team=frontend label match this sub-route.
  # They are grouped by product and environment rather than cluster
  # and alertname.
  - receiver: 'frontend-pager'
    group_by: [product, environment]
    matchers:
    - team="frontend"

  # All alerts with the service=inhouse-service label match this sub-route.
  # the route will be muted during offhours and holidays time intervals.
  # even if it matches, it will continue to the next sub-route
  - receiver: 'dev-pager'
    matchers:
      - service="inhouse-service"
    mute_time_intervals:
      - offhours
      - holidays
    continue: true

    # All alerts with the service=inhouse-service label match this sub-route
    # the route will be active only during offhours and holidays time intervals.
  - receiver: 'on-call-pager'
    matchers:
      - service="inhouse-service"
    active_time_intervals:
      - offhours
      - holidays
```

### `<time_interval>`

A `time_interval` specifies a named interval of time that may be referenced
in the routing tree to mute/activate particular routes for particular times of the day.

```yaml
name: <string>
time_intervals:
  [ - <time_interval_spec> ... ]
```
#### `<time_interval_spec>`

A `time_interval_spec` contains the actual definition for an interval of time. The syntax
supports the following fields:

```yaml
- times:
  [ - <time_range> ...]
  weekdays:
  [ - <weekday_range> ...]
  days_of_month:
  [ - <days_of_month_range> ...]
  months:
  [ - <month_range> ...]
  years:
  [ - <year_range> ...]
  location: <string>
```

All fields are lists. Within each non-empty list, at least one element must be satisfied to match
the field. If a field is left unspecified, any value will match the field. For an instant of time
to match a complete time interval, all fields must match.
Some fields support ranges and negative indices, and are detailed below. If a time zone is not
specified, then the times are taken to be in UTC.

`time_range`: Ranges inclusive of the starting time and exclusive of the end time to
make it easy to represent times that start/end on hour boundaries.
For example, `start_time: '17:00'` and `end_time: '24:00'` will begin at 17:00 and finish
immediately before 24:00. They are specified like so:

        times:
        - start_time: HH:MM
          end_time: HH:MM

`weekday_range`: A list of days of the week, where the week begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday.
Days should be specified by name (e.g. 'Sunday'). For convenience, ranges are also accepted
of the form `<start_day>:<end_day>` and are inclusive on both ends. For example:
`['monday:wednesday','saturday', 'sunday']`

`days_of_month_range`: A list of numerical days in the month. Days begin at 1.
Negative values are also accepted which begin at the end of the month,
e.g. -1 during January would represent January 31. For example: `['1:5', '-3:-1']`.
Extending past the start or end of the month will cause it to be clamped. E.g. specifying
`['1:31']` during February will clamp the actual end date to 28 or 29 depending on leap years.
Inclusive on both ends.

`month_range`: A list of calendar months identified by a case-insensitive name (e.g. 'January') or by number,
where January = 1. Ranges are also accepted. For example, `['1:3', 'may:august', 'december']`.
Inclusive on both ends.

`year_range`: A numerical list of years. Ranges are accepted. For example, `['2020:2022', '2030']`.
Inclusive on both ends.

`location`: A string that matches a location in the IANA time zone database. For
example, `'Australia/Sydney'`. The location provides the time zone for the time
interval. For example, a time interval with a location of `'Australia/Sydney'` that
contained something like:

        times:
        - start_time: 09:00
          end_time: 17:00
        weekdays: ['monday:friday']

would include any time that fell between the hours of 9:00AM and 5:00PM, between Monday
and Friday, using the local time in Sydney, Australia.

You may also use `'Local'` as a location to use the local time of the machine where
Alertmanager is running, or `'UTC'` for UTC time. If no timezone is provided, the time
interval is taken to be in UTC time.**Note:** On Windows, only `Local` or `UTC` are
supported unless you provide a custom time zone database using the `ZONEINFO`
environment variable.

## Inhibition-related settings

Inhibition allows muting a set of alerts based on the presence of another set of
alerts. This allows establishing dependencies between systems or services such that
only the most relevant of a set of interconnected alerts are sent out during an outage.

### `<inhibit_rule>`

An inhibition rule mutes an alert (target) matching a set of matchers
when an alert (source) exists that matches another set of matchers.
Both target and source alerts must have the same label values
for the label names in the `equal` list.

Semantically, a missing label and a label with an empty value are the same
thing. Therefore, if all the label names listed in `equal` are missing from
both the source and target alerts, the inhibition rule will apply.

To prevent an alert from inhibiting itself, an alert that matches _both_ the
target and the source side of a rule cannot be inhibited by alerts for which
the same is true (including itself). However, we recommend to choose target and
source matchers in a way that alerts never match both sides. It is much easier
to reason about and does not trigger this special case.

```yaml
# DEPRECATED: Use target_matchers below.
# Matchers that have to be fulfilled in the alerts to be muted.
target_match:
  [ <labelname>: <labelvalue>, ... ]
# DEPRECATED: Use target_matchers below.
target_match_re:
  [ <labelname>: <regex>, ... ]

# A list of matchers that have to be fulfilled by the target
# alerts to be muted.
target_matchers:
  [ - <matcher> ... ]

# DEPRECATED: Use source_matchers below.
# Matchers for which one or more alerts have to exist for the
# inhibition to take effect.
source_match:
  [ <labelname>: <labelvalue>, ... ]
# DEPRECATED: Use source_matchers below.
source_match_re:
  [ <labelname>: <regex>, ... ]

# A list of matchers for which one or more alerts have
# to exist for the inhibition to take effect.
source_matchers:
  [ - <matcher> ... ]

# Labels that must have an equal value in the source and target
# alert for the inhibition to take effect.
[ equal: '[' <labelname>, ... ']' ]

```

## Label matchers

Label matchers are used both in routes and inhibition rules to match certain alerts.

### `<matcher>`

A matcher is a string with a syntax inspired by PromQL and OpenMetrics. The syntax of a matcher consists of three tokens:

- A valid Prometheus label name.

- One of  `=`, `!=`, `=~`, or `!~`. `=` means equals, `!=` means that the strings are not equal, `=~` is used for equality of regex expressions and `!~` is used for un-equality of regex expressions. They have the same meaning as known from PromQL selectors.

- A UTF-8 string, which may be enclosed in double quotes. Before or after each token, there may be any amount of whitespace.

The 3rd token may be the empty string. Within the 3rd token, OpenMetrics escaping rules apply: `\"` for a double-quote, `\n` for a line feed, `\\` for a literal backslash. Unescaped `"` must not occur inside the 3rd token (only as the 1st or last character). However, literal line feed characters are tolerated, as are single `\` characters not followed by `\`, `n`, or `"`. They act as a literal backslash in that case.

Matchers are ANDed together, meaning that all matchers must evaluate to "true" when tested against the labels on a given alert. For example, an alert with these labels:

```json
{"alertname":"Watchdog","severity":"none"}
```

would NOT match this list of matchers:

```yaml
matchers:
  - alertname = Watchdog
  - severity =~ "warning|critical"
```

In the configuration, multiple matchers are combined in a YAML list. However, it is also possible to combine multiple matchers within a single YAML string, again using syntax inspired by PromQL. In such a string, a leading `{` and/or a trailing `}` is optional and will be trimmed before further parsing. Individual matchers are separated by commas outside of quoted parts of the string. Those commas may be surrounded by whitespace. Parts of the string inside unescaped double quotes `"…"` are considered quoted (and commas don't act as separators there). If double quotes are escaped with a single backslash `\`, they are ignored for the purpose of identifying quoted parts of the input string. If the input string, after trimming the optional trailing `}`, ends with a comma, followed by optional whitespace, this comma and whitespace will be trimmed.

Here are some examples of valid string matchers:

1. Shown below are two equality matchers combined in a long form YAML list.

    ```yaml
    matchers:
      - foo = bar
      - dings !=bums
    ```

2. Similar to example 1, shown below are two equality matchers combined in a short form YAML list.

    ```yaml
    matchers: [ foo = bar, dings != bums ]
    ```

    As shown below, in the short-form, it's generally better to quote the list elements to avoid problems with special characters like commas:

    ```yaml
    matchers: [ "foo = \"bar,baz\"", "dings != bums" ]
    ```

3. You can also put both matchers into one PromQL-like string. Single quotes for the whole string work best here.

    ```yaml
    matchers: [ '{foo="bar",dings!="bums"}' ]
    ```

4. To avoid any confusion about YAML string quoting and escaping, you can use YAML block quoting and then only worry about the OpenMetrics escaping inside the block. A complex example with a regular expression and different quotes inside the label value is shown below:

    ```yaml
    matchers:
      - |
          {quote=~"She said: \"Hi, all!( How're you…)?\""}
    ```

## General receiver-related settings

These receiver settings allow configuring notification destinations (receivers) and HTTP client options for HTTP-based receivers.

### `<receiver>`

Receiver is a named configuration of one or more notification integrations.

Note: As part of lifting the past moratorium on new receivers it was agreed that, in addition to the existing requirements, new notification integrations will be required to have a committed maintainer with push access.

```yaml
# The unique name of the receiver.
name: <string>

# Configurations for several notification integrations.
discord_configs:
  [ - <discord_config>, ... ]
email_configs:
  [ - <email_config>, ... ]
msteams_configs:
  [ - <msteams_config>, ... ]
opsgenie_configs:
  [ - <opsgenie_config>, ... ]
pagerduty_configs:
  [ - <pagerduty_config>, ... ]
pushover_configs:
  [ - <pushover_config>, ... ]
slack_configs:
  [ - <slack_config>, ... ]
sns_configs:
  [ - <sns_config>, ... ]
telegram_configs:
  [ - <telegram_config>, ... ]
victorops_configs:
  [ - <victorops_config>, ... ]
webex_configs:
  [ - <webex_config>, ... ]
webhook_configs:
  [ - <webhook_config>, ... ]
wechat_configs:
  [ - <wechat_config>, ... ]
```

### `<http_config>`

An `http_config` allows configuring the HTTP client that the receiver uses to
communicate with HTTP-based API services.

```yaml
# Note that `basic_auth` and `authorization` options are mutually exclusive.

# Sets the `Authorization` header with the configured username and password.
# password and password_file are mutually exclusive.
basic_auth:
  [ username: <string> ]
  [ password: <secret> ]
  [ password_file: <string> ]

# Optional the `Authorization` header configuration.
authorization:
  # Sets the authentication type.
  [ type: <string> | default: Bearer ]
  # Sets the credentials. It is mutually exclusive with
  # `credentials_file`.
  [ credentials: <secret> ]
  # Sets the credentials with the credentials read from the configured file.
  # It is mutually exclusive with `credentials`.
  [ credentials_file: <filename> ]

# Optional OAuth 2.0 configuration.
# Cannot be used at the same time as basic_auth or authorization.
oauth2:
  [ <oauth2> ]

# Whether to enable HTTP2.
[ enable_http2: <bool> | default: true ]

# Optional proxy URL.
[ proxy_url: <string> ]
# Comma-separated string that can contain IPs, CIDR notation, domain names
# that should be excluded from proxying. IP and domain names can
# contain port numbers.
[ no_proxy: <string> ]
# Use proxy URL indicated by environment variables (HTTP_PROXY, http_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY, https_proxy, NO_PROXY, and no_proxy)
[ proxy_from_environment: <boolean> | default: false ]
# Specifies headers to send to proxies during CONNECT requests.
[ proxy_connect_header:
  [ <string>: [<secret>, ...] ] ]

# Configure whether HTTP requests follow HTTP 3xx redirects.
[ follow_redirects: <bool> | default = true ]

# Configures the TLS settings.
tls_config:
  [ <tls_config> ]
```

#### `<oauth2>`

OAuth 2.0 authentication using the client credentials grant type.
Alertmanager fetches an access token from the specified endpoint with
the given client access and secret keys.

```yaml
client_id: <string>
[ client_secret: <secret> ]

# Read the client secret from a file.
# It is mutually exclusive with `client_secret`.
[ client_secret_file: <filename> ]

# Scopes for the token request.
scopes:
  [ - <string> ... ]

# The URL to fetch the token from.
token_url: <string>

# Optional parameters to append to the token URL.
endpoint_params:
  [ <string>: <string> ... ]

# Configures the token request's TLS settings.
tls_config:
  [ <tls_config> ]

# Optional proxy URL.
[ proxy_url: <string> ]
# Comma-separated string that can contain IPs, CIDR notation, domain names
# that should be excluded from proxying. IP and domain names can
# contain port numbers.
[ no_proxy: <string> ]
# Use proxy URL indicated by environment variables (HTTP_PROXY, https_proxy, HTTPs_PROXY, https_proxy, and no_proxy)
[ proxy_from_environment: <boolean> | default: false ]
# Specifies headers to send to proxies during CONNECT requests.
[ proxy_connect_header:
  [ <string>: [<secret>, ...] ] ]
```

#### `<tls_config>`

A `tls_config` allows configuring TLS connections.

```yaml
# CA certificate to validate the server certificate with.
[ ca_file: <filepath> ]

# Certificate and key files for client cert authentication to the server.
[ cert_file: <filepath> ]
[ key_file: <filepath> ]

# ServerName extension to indicate the name of the server.
# http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4366#section-3.1
[ server_name: <string> ]

# Disable validation of the server certificate.
[ insecure_skip_verify: <boolean> | default = false]

# Minimum acceptable TLS version. Accepted values: TLS10 (TLS 1.0), TLS11 (TLS
# 1.1), TLS12 (TLS 1.2), TLS13 (TLS 1.3).
# If unset, Prometheus will use Go default minimum version, which is TLS 1.2.
# See MinVersion in https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/tls#Config.
[ min_version: <string> ]
# Maximum acceptable TLS version. Accepted values: TLS10 (TLS 1.0), TLS11 (TLS
# 1.1), TLS12 (TLS 1.2), TLS13 (TLS 1.3).
# If unset, Prometheus will use Go default maximum version, which is TLS 1.3.
# See MaxVersion in https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/tls#Config.
[ max_version: <string> ]
```

## Receiver integration settings

These settings allow configuring specific receiver integrations.

### `<discord_config>`

Discord notifications are sent via the [Discord webhook API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook). See Discord's ["Intro to Webhooks" article](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) to learn how to configure a webhook integration for a channel.

```yaml
# Whether to notify about resolved alerts.

# The Discord webhook URL.
webhook_url: <secret>

# Message title template.
[ title: <tmpl_string> | default = '{{ template "discord.default.title" . }}' ]

# Message body template.
[ message: <tmpl_string> | default = '{{ template "discord.default.message" . }}' ]

# The HTTP client's configuration.

### `<slack_config>`

Slack notifications can be sent via [Incoming webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) or [Bot tokens](https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types).

If using an incoming webhook then `api_url` must be set to the URL of the incoming webhook, or written to the file referenced in `api_url_file`.

If using Bot tokens then `api_url` must be set to [`https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage`](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage), the bot token must be set as the authorization credentials in `http_config`, and `channel` must contain either the name of the channel or Channel ID to send notifications to. If using the name of the channel the # is optional.

The notification contains an [attachment](https://api.slack.com/messaging/composing/layouts#attachments).

```yaml
